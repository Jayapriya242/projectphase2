## CONVERSATIONAL AI WITH WHISPER AND CHATGPT : ENHANCING SPEECH-TO-TEXT AI RECOGNITION
This project aims to enhance speech recognition and conversational AI by integrating Whisper AI, an advanced speech-to-text model, with ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art NLP model. Whisper AI enables highly accurate transcription of spoken language, even in noisy environments, while ChatGPT processes and generates human-like responses based on the transcribed text. Together, these technologies create a seamless voice assistant capable of understanding, processing, and responding to user queries in real-time.

## About
The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly improved the capabilities of Conversational AI, particularly in the areas of speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP). This project aims to develop an AI-powered voice assistant by integrating Whisper AI, a state-of-the-art speech-to-text model, with ChatGPT, an advanced language model for conversational AI.
Whisper AI, developed by OpenAI, is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system capable of transcribing speech with high accuracy, even in noisy environments. It supports multiple languages and can handle real-time audio input for seamless transcription. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) designed for human-like conversations. It processes the transcribed text from Whisper AI and generates meaningful, context-aware responses. The system captures voice input, converts it into text using Whisper AI, and passes the transcribed text to ChatGPT. ChatGPT processes the text and generates a natural language response, which can then be converted back into speech (optional).The system is designed to support various applications, including virtual assistants, customer service chatbots, smart home control, and accessibility tools for individuals with disabilities.
By leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, this project aims to bridge the gap between human speech and AI-driven text processing, enabling more natural and efficient human-computer interactions. The system’s ability to understand, process, and respond to voice inputs in real-time makes it a valuable tool for numerous applications, ranging from automated customer support to AI-driven accessibility solutions.
In addition to enhancing speech-to-text accuracy, the project focuses on real-time processing and low-latency response generation, ensuring seamless user interaction. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the system continuously improves its understanding of different accents, dialects, and speech patterns.
